# MosquitoDB

## This is my Honors Thesis Project for the Barrett Honors College at ASU

### The Thesis/Creative Project is to complete MosquitoDB by April of 2017, with the following features implemented and tested:
1) Web Interface for manually submitting data forms or uploading files of formatted mosquito population data 
2) Web Interface for querying and downloading mosquito population data 
3) Public RESTful API for submitting and retrieving mosquito population data 

### If the the project progresses faster than planned, the following features will be attempted:
* Minimum Infectivity Rate calculations 
* Geospatial Data Visualization tools 

#### This Thesis/Creative Project is in collaboration with viral phylogeography researchers from the Biodesign Center for Environmental Security
